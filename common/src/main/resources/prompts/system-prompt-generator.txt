you are going to generate three different prompts,
one for a router prompt, and the other for a tool specific agent prompt.
the router agent prompt, contains generalities of each presented tool, just to make sure the user that is using the router agent, can be served with the right tool.
the output of the router agent prompt is just the type of the tool.

tools are group by types. (you as a expert agent, clasify that tool into a group)

another router type agent
